# AutoDealFinder(An Ongoing Project) – Intelligent Agent-Based Deal Discovery

## Overview

**AutoDealFinder** is an AI-powered platform that uses autonomous agents to monitor, analyze, and alert users about time-sensitive deals. Built using cutting-edge technologies including fine-tuned language models and Modal cloud infrastructure, this project demonstrates how smart automation can transform the way consumers and businesses find the best deals online.

Whether you're a solo shopper looking for the best price on a laptop or a business optimizing procurement, AutoDealFinder can save you time and money.


## Real-World Use Cases

- **Personal Shopper Assistant**  
  A user sets criteria (e.g., "laptop under $500"), and the system tracks platforms like Amazon, BestBuy, and eBay, sending alerts when a deal matches.

- **SME Procurement Tool**  
  Small businesses automate the hunt for bulk discounts on supplies or equipment, reducing reliance on manual searches or procurement teams.

- **Market Monitoring for Dropshipping**  
  Dropshippers receive alerts on trending products or steep discounts to gain competitive edge before the market reacts.

- **Coupon & Promo Automation**  
  Integrates with coupon sites and discount aggregators to notify users when both a price drop *and* a coupon is available.

- **Travel Deals**  
  (Future scope) Monitor flight and hotel prices across platforms, applying Hopper-style logic with multi-agent alerts.

- **Scalper Buster**  
  Track high-demand restocks (like GPUs, PS5s, sneakers) and notify users faster than typical shopping bots.
